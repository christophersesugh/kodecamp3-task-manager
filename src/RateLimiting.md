# Rate limiting

Express rate limiting is a technique used to restrict the number of requests a client (usually identified by their IP address) can make to an Express.js server within a specified time window. Rate limiting helps protect your server from abuse, DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, and ensures fair resource allocation among clients. It can be particularly useful when dealing with APIs or public-facing services.

Here's how to implement rate limiting in an Express.js application:

1. **Install Required Middleware:**
   First, you'll need to install a rate limiting middleware for Express.js. A popular choice is the `express-rate-limit` middleware. You can install it using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install express-rate-limit
   ```

   For `yarn` users

   ```bash
   yarn add express-rate-limit
   ```

2. **Import and Configure the Middleware:**
   In your Express.js application, import the `express-rate-limit` middleware and configure it with your desired options. For example:

   ```javascript
   import express from "express";
   import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";

   const app = express();

   // Create a rate limiter with desired options
   const limiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
     message: "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.",
   });

   // Apply the rate limiter to all routes or specific routes
   app.use(limiter);

   // Your routes and other middleware go here
   ```

   In this example, we've configured a rate limiter that allows a maximum of 100 requests per IP address within a 15-minute window. If a client exceeds this limit, they will receive the specified error message.

3. **Use the Middleware in Your Routes:**
   Once you've created and applied the rate limiter middleware, it will automatically be applied to all routes. However, you can also choose to apply it only to specific routes by placing `limiter` before the route handler:

   ```javascript
   app.get("/limited-route", limiter, (req, res) => {
     // Your route logic here
   });
   ```

   This way, you can have different rate limiting rules for different routes if needed.

4. **Customize Error Responses:**
   You can customize the error response sent to clients who exceed the rate limit by providing the `message` option when configuring the rate limiter. This message will be included in the response when the limit is exceeded.

Rate limiting is an essential security measure to protect your server from abuse, but it should be configured carefully to balance security and user experience. You should adjust the `windowMs` (time window) and `max` (maximum requests) values to suit your application's needs and expected traffic patterns.
